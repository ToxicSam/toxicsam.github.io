			<p>Tomorrow, tomorrow, and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day, until the last syllable of recorded time. And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death. Out, out brief candle. Life is but a walking shadow. A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is no more.</p>

			<p>
			<b>Robert Qiu:</b> In the proposal phase, my role was to coordinate the meetings and make sure weâ€™re all on the same page, and once we settled on a topic and wrote down everything on a google doc, I was also responsible for transitioning all of this onto the website. In the milestone phase, when we were mainly doing research, I spent most of my time looking at shaders on ShaderToy and figuring out what type of shader we want to do and how to do it. I experimented with some shaders on the site by modifying values and watching how the shader transforms in real time. I was also once again responsible for transferring our milestone report onto the website. In the final phase, I was responsible for setting up the demo scene in Unity, creating a visually stunning scene with easy to use UI for modifying shader values, and hooking everything up so that you can interact with the UI and see your changes reflected in real time. I wrote a script that hooked up the UI events to setting shader values as well as toggling certain camera effects. I worked with Sam in setting this scene up with the glitch effect shader he worked on, and paid very close attention to detail, to make sure that it brought out the best of the shader and truly impressed aesthetically.

			<b>Sanwu Luo:</b> In the project, I was responsible for implementing the glitch shaders. From scratch, I did some research of basic Unity shaders and devised several features of our shader. From the planned features, I searched for some referenced implementation on shadertoy. However, due to the fact that ShaderToy used a different shader language than Unity, I had to create my own shader into Unity. On top of that, in order to control the randomness of the shader, I also wrote the Unity controller script.

<p>
<b>Brandon Bizzarro:</b> Implemented our modified Blinn-Phong Toon shader. Designed and implemented our dither shader. Designed and created our final website's html/css.  Miscellaneous Unity scripts and assets.
